- 👋 Hi, I’m @Troi220

- 👀 I’m interested in Programming Games and other stuff like app's, i did by my self an app that create citations in MLA.


- 🌱 I’m currently learning Economics, but i love to learn how to programm,
      my first language was VBA, then i learn Python for data analisys, 
      in my University. After that i start learn by my self, JavaScript,
      and tried C++ and C# to use in Unity, but it didn't go soo well
      right now i know languagues more focus on data, like R.
      
      
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing right now, don't have that much time
